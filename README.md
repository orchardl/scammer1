# scammer1
This was a pretty clever one if I do say so myself.

This one ran for about 5 hours with about 1000 false form submissions.
At this point I began to wonder if I could start uploading larger and
larger files with the hope of knocking out the webserver. 
Unfortunately, while testing this, I uploaded about 180 GB of dummy
images. This took out the webserver, so I was never able to implement
the same in this script
